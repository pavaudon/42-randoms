### The worst companies to work for

> **_⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️_**  You must relate facts. No diffamation is allowed.


- Natixis (groupebpce) J'ai eu de très mauvais retour de 5 studs qui ont fait un stage là-bas, et moi-même j'ai vu de choses vraiment border Line limite illégal
- Data-B : During my internship, i was the only developper and my work was not really legal.
- Safran : Work seem cool, but it is not.
- Alten : It's an Esn. They’ll offer you a mission. The mission can be completely different (example: embedded development which in reality is only test where you do not touch the code). When you tell them you want to change your mission to do your job, they can threaten you.
- Astek : They promise you to be a different ESN with a lot of 42. There is a manager who is excellent (the only one there) and they present him to you during the recruitment so that you have a good vision of them. They are no better than other ESN. They force you to accept any mission even if it is more than 2 hours from home or if it is not your job.
